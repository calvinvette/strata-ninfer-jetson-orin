<h1 align="center">Strata + NInfer for Jetson Orin</h1>

This repository is a derivative of **[Strata by Niko1221 and its contributors](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata)**,
developed at [calvinvette/strata-ninfer-jetson-orin](https://github.com/calvinvette/strata-ninfer-jetson-orin).
It starts from [the Strata Orin port](https://github.com/calvinvette/strata-inference-orin) and brings in
the source, tests, architecture and measured lessons from [the NInfer Orin port](https://github.com/calvinvette/ninfer-jetson-orin).
The inherited runtime supports ARM64 and shared physical RAM on **NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin 32 GB**, running
**JetPack 6.2 with CUDA 12.6 (SM87)**. The original engine, server, web app and desktop features come from Strata.
Strata retains its [MIT license](LICENSE); imported NInfer code retains its Apache-2.0 license and
[source attribution](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

Development is on **`main`**. The [integration guide](docs/integration/README.md) links the
[multi-phase plan](docs/integration/PLAN.md), [architecture](docs/integration/ARCHITECTURE.md),
[parametric/multivariate benchmark protocol](docs/integration/BENCHMARKS.md),
[source import map](docs/integration/IMPORT_MAP.md) and [status](docs/integration/STATUS.md).
The repository and reference import are complete; runtime integration and its measurements are pending.
The results below are inherited Strata results, not measurements of a combined engine.
The translated READMEs describe the original project and have not been updated for this integration.

## What this fork adds

- Local ARM64 builds targeting SM87, portable CPU kernels and pinned ggml's ARM backend.
- A single physical RAM budget for CPU and GPU allocations, with file-backed experts when they do not fit in RAM.
- ARM synchronization for CUDA mapped host buffers, registration fallback and tested VMM cache resizing.
- Jetson setup that preserves JetPack's CUDA libraries and avoids x86 binaries and desktop CUDA packages.
- CPU and CUDA image encoder builds, real API validation and reproducible hardware results.

Orin's CPU and GPU share its 32 GB of RAM; there is no separate 32 GB VRAM pool. The runtime leaves six GiB
of physical RAM headroom by default and an additional three GiB for late workspaces when sizing the automatic
expert cache. Managed memory is supported for sequential ownership, but this Orin reports no concurrent
managed access. The port retains device allocations and mapped control buffers rather than replacing them
with managed allocations.

## Measured on Jetson AGX Orin 32 GB

The tested model is **Qwen3.8-Flash-Next Coder IQ1_M**, with file-backed experts, MTP spec 4 and prefill batch 64.
These measurements used JetPack 6.2, CUDA 12.6.68, MAXN power mode and unlocked clocks.
The table below records the original 0.1.40.3 port; the [0.1.41 rebase validation and context sweep](bench/results/2026-10-08-jetson-orin/README.md#rebase-onto-upstream-0141) preserves the same-day comparison separately.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Decode, three runs per prompt size with 64-token replies | Median 18.6–21.6 tokens/s |
| Prefill, 172–1069 prompt tokens | Median 37.8–52.5 tokens/s |
| Long prompt at context limit 32768 | 31234 tokens processed in 584 seconds; expected reply and follow-up passed |
| Available physical RAM across the 32K run | At least 7.33 GiB; swap was in use |
| Real API checks | Repeated greedy replies, OpenAI/Anthropic streaming and cancellation recovery passed |
| Vision | CPU/CUDA encoding and repeated image API requests passed for a 56-by-56 image with a 16-token encoder cap |

After rebasing onto upstream 0.1.41, all nine requested capacities from 1K through 256K passed.
At context 262144, a 261936-token prompt completed at 58.5 prompt tokens/s, followed by 64 generated
tokens at 6.6 tokens/s and a successful recovery check. Minimum available RAM was 9.33 GiB;
swap was in use. Larger contexts reduce the automatic expert cache and decode throughput.
The linked report contains the same-day baseline, three matched runs per short prompt and one near-limit
run per capacity, with raw results and allocation differences.

See the [phased implementation plan](docs/JETSON_ORIN_PLAN.md),
[portability tests](bench/results/2026-10-07-jetson-orin/README.md) and
[real-model results, commands and limits](bench/results/2026-10-08-jetson-orin/README.md).
Other model variants, larger images and controlled thermal tests have not been validated on this host.
Formatted chat prompts agreed with the CPU reference's top token, but raw-token log probabilities differed;
universal numerical parity is not established. Desktop setup regressions and x86 CPU cross-builds passed;
desktop GPU runtime was not tested on the Orin.

## Install this fork on Orin

Use an NVMe SSD with room for the model downloads and prepared packs. This port builds from source using
JetPack's installed CUDA 12.6 toolkit:

```bash
git clone --branch main https://github.com/calvinvette/strata-ninfer-jetson-orin.git
cd strata-ninfer-jetson-orin
./setup.sh --cuda 12
```

Close other large memory users before loading the model. Choose Coder IQ1_M for the measured configuration;
32 GB shared RAM does not provide the same allocation budget as 32 GB system RAM plus a discrete GPU.
Start with a short context and use the [recorded configuration](bench/results/2026-10-08-jetson-orin/README.md)
when reproducing the measurements. Keep the server on `127.0.0.1`; configuring an external listener requires
`--api-key`. For setup details, see [AI_SETUP.md](docs/AI_SETUP.md) and [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Original Strata features and desktop results

The following overview and desktop measurements are retained from the original Strata project. They describe
its Windows/Linux desktop configurations and are separate from the Orin measurements above.

Strata runs **[Qwen3.8-Flash-Next](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next)** on a normal PC. This is a
large, smart AI model that usually needs a server. It chats, writes code, reads pictures and works with your apps
and coding agents. Nothing leaves your PC.

## Upstream desktop performance

The original Strata project measured it on two ordinary gaming PCs. A token is about ¾ of a word.

- **Writes answers:** how fast the reply appears in a short chat. 60 tokens per second is faster than you can read.
- **Reads your prompt:** how fast it takes in what you send (here a 32K-token document, code or chat history).

<table>
<tr><th>NVIDIA: RTX 5070 (12 GB), Ryzen 5 7600, 64 GB RAM</th><th>AMD: RX 9070 XT (16 GB), Ryzen 9 3900X, 47 GB RAM</th></tr>
<tr><td>

| Size | Writes answers | Reads your prompt |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 94 tokens/s | 2,650 tokens/s |
| **IQ2_XS** | 79 tokens/s | 2,090 tokens/s |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 62 tokens/s | 1,750 tokens/s |

NVIDIA: Q2_0 with engine 0.1.36, the other rows with 0.1.26 (4K answers, 32K prompts). The full tables are in
[DETAILS.md](docs/DETAILS.md#speed-measured). A card with more VRAM is faster: an RTX 3090 (24 GB) should write
about 100-140 tokens per second. Long chats and other cards: [speed of each model](docs/MODELS.md#how-fast-is-each-size),

## Desktop requirements

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Graphics card** | **NVIDIA** GeForce RTX 20, 30, 40 or 50 series, or **AMD** Radeon RX 7900 XT / XTX, RX 7800 XT / 7700 XT, RX 9060 XT, RX 9070 / 9070 XT, Radeon AI PRO R9700 or RX 6800 / 6900 series. It needs **12 GB of VRAM or more**. |
| **RAM** | 32 GB or more. Your RAM decides [which model](#which-model-should-i-pick) fits. 64 GB runs every size. |
| **Disk** | About 80 GB free. Use an SSD if you can: the first start is much faster. |
| **System** | Windows 10 / 11 or Linux, and a current graphics driver from NVIDIA or AMD. |

The installer sets up everything else. Two or three cards can share the model ([multi-GPU](docs/MULTI_GPU.md)).

Experimental, written and tested by community members on their own machines:

- **Older graphics cards** (Tesla P40 / V100, GTX 10, Radeon VII / MI50, RX 6700 XT, RX 5500 XT): [Older GPUs](docs/OLDER_GPUS.md).
- **Intel Arc**, built from source on Linux: [Intel Arc](docs/INTEL_ARC.md).
- **AMD Ryzen AI Max (Strix Halo)**, built from source on Linux: [Strix Halo](docs/STRIX_HALO.md).
- **Older processors without AVX2**: they work, but slowly. [Older CPUs](docs/INSTALL.md#older-cpus-experimental).

The full list: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md#what-you-need).

## Desktop installation

### Let your AI set it up

Do you use an AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, ...)? Paste this into it:

```text
Set up Strata from https://github.com/calvinvette/strata-ninfer-jetson-orin, branch main.
Follow docs/AI_SETUP.md and the Jetson section of README.md in that repository.
```

It checks your graphics card, RAM and disk and picks the model that fits. Then it installs and starts it and tells
you how to connect your apps. AI tools can also install, start and stop Strata through its
[MCP server](docs/MCP_SERVER.md).

### Or do it yourself

[Download this fork](https://github.com/calvinvette/strata-ninfer-jetson-orin/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it (or `git clone` it).
**Windows:** double-click **`START-HERE.bat`**. **Linux:** run **`./setup.sh`** in the Strata folder.

The steps are the same for NVIDIA and AMD. The installer finds your card and sets up the right engine for it. It
asks you a few questions:

- which model and which size,
- how much context (how much text the model keeps in mind),
- whether it should read pictures.

Press Enter each time for the recommended answer. Then it downloads the model (about 70 GB) and starts it. If the
download stops, run it again: it continues where it left off. Your browser opens the Strata app at
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

> **While the model starts, your PC can be slow or stop responding for 1-3 minutes** (longest the first time).
> Strata loads 35-55 GB into your RAM and locks part of it for the graphics card. This is normal. Wait, and don't
> close the window. The window shows what Strata is doing.

**Next time**, run `START-HERE.bat` (or `./setup.sh`) again. It starts right away and downloads nothing twice. Close
its window to stop the model. `UPDATE.bat` (`./update.sh`) updates Strata without starting it. Updating, Docker,
several cards, where the files go and every option: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Which model should I pick?

The installer recommends one for your RAM. The same model comes in several sizes, compressed more or less. Smaller
sizes are faster. Larger sizes are a bit smarter.

| Your RAM | Take | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **32 GB** | **Coder** | it fits 32 GB, and it is made for code (with a 24 GB card, Q2_0 and IQ2_XS run too) |
| **48 GB** | **IQ2_XS** (or Q2_0, the fastest) | the larger sizes do not fit |
| **64 GB** | **IQ2_XS** (recommended), or IQ3_XXS / IQ3_S | every size fits; IQ3_S is the best and the slowest |
| **96 GB or more** | **IQ3_S**, or Unsloth's UD-IQ4_XS (~4-bit) | room for the largest sizes with everything else open |

- **[Coder](docs/MODELS.md#coder):** a coding version with half of the experts removed. It reaches 91% of the full
  model's SWE-bench Verified score (measured by its authors) and fits 32 GB of RAM. It is weaker outside code,
  including Chinese and other CJK text (#438). For those, take Q2_0, IQ2_XS or IQ3_S, which keep every expert.
- **[Swift 1.5](docs/MODELS.md#swift-15):** a fine-tune that thinks for a much shorter time before it answers. You
  get the answer sooner, at about the same quality.
- **[Unsloth UD-IQ4_XS](docs/MODELS.md#unsloth-ud-iq4_xs):** Unsloth's ~4-bit version, between IQ3_S and
  UD-Q4_K_XL in quality. A 94 GB download. With less than ~80 GB of RAM, Strata reads part of it from the SSD
  while it answers, so it is slower there (an NVMe SSD helps).
- **[Unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL](docs/MODELS.md#unsloth-ud-q4_k_xl-experimental)** (experimental): the closest to the full
  model. But Strata reads most of it from the SSD while it answers, so it writes only 7-8.5 tokens/s on a 64 GB PC.
- **[OrcaRouter's Uncensored IQ3_XXS](docs/MODELS.md#orcarouter-uncensored-iq3_xxs):** you set it up by hand. It is
  not in the installer's menu.

Sizes, downloads and what fits where: [docs/MODELS.md](docs/MODELS.md). To add another model later, run
`SETUP.bat` (Linux: `./setup.sh --setup`).

## Using it

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/runpagoda.png" width="900" alt="The Strata app's Monitor tab next to a coding agent"><br>
<sub>The Strata app's <b>Monitor</b> (left) while a coding agent writes the pagoda garden from the video (right)</sub></p>

- **In the browser:** open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. It has **Chat**, a live **Monitor** of the model and your
  GPU/CPU/RAM, and **About** with the settings and addresses.
- **Your apps and coding agents:** add an "OpenAI-compatible" provider with the base URL
  **`http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`**. Any API key and any model name work.
  - Apps that use Anthropic's API: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/messages` (Claude Code:
    `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080`).
  - Codex CLI and other apps that use the OpenAI Responses API: `/v1/responses`
    ([setup](docs/DETAILS.md#the-responses-api-and-codex-cli)).
- **Thinking:** choose **off, low, medium or high** in the chat menu or in your app's "reasoning effort". Off is the
  fastest. High is best for hard questions.
- **Pictures:** say yes to "Images?" in setup. Then click **Picture** in the chat, or attach pictures in your app.
  AMD cards read pictures on Linux through the processor; on Windows they can't yet.
- **From your phone or another PC:** `START-HERE.bat --setup --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key <secret>`. Always set a key.
- **One request at a time:** by default Strata answers one request, and the others wait. To answer several at once,
  set `"parallel": 2` ([BATCHING.md](docs/BATCHING.md)). On a 12 GB card this makes each answer slower.
- **Long prompts:** Strata reads the first message of a chat in full, about 1 minute per 30,000 tokens. Follow-up
  messages start in seconds.

More: [where your chats are stored](docs/INSTALL.md#where-things-are-stored), [the API](docs/DETAILS.md#using-it).

## Something went wrong?

- **My PC froze the first time Strata started.** This is normal while it loads the model. Wait, and don't close the
  window. Still frozen after 10 minutes? Restart the PC, close other programs and try again, or pick a smaller size.
- **It stopped while downloading or installing.** Run `START-HERE.bat` (or `./setup.sh`) again. It continues where
  it stopped.
- **It's very slow and the disk light keeps blinking, or it says "the engine stopped unexpectedly".** Your PC does
  not have enough free RAM. Close other programs (browsers use a lot), or pick a smaller size (Q2_0 or IQ2_XS).
- **It says port 8080 is already in use.** Strata is already running. Look for its window.

More problems and their fixes: [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Still stuck? Open an
[issue](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/issues) and attach `strata-<model>.log` from the Strata folder. Found a
security problem? Report it privately: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## How does it work?

Models like this one usually run on servers with hundreds of gigabytes of graphics memory. Your graphics card has
12-24 GB. Strata makes the model fit by **sharing the work across your whole PC**. Think of a kitchen: the things
you use all the time stay on the counter, and the rest waits in the pantry.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/how-it-works.svg" width="860" alt="The model's 24,576 experts: the busiest on the graphics card, all of them in RAM, a lookup table on the SSD"></p>

- **The model is a team of 24,576 small specialists ("experts").** Each word needs only 10 of them.
- **Your graphics card** keeps the few thousand experts that are used most often. **Your RAM** holds all of them,
  and **your processor** works on the rest at the same time. **Your SSD** holds a big lookup table.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/guess-and-check.svg" width="860" alt="A small helper guesses the next words; the big model checks them all at once and keeps the right ones"></p>

- **Guess, then check:** a small helper guesses the next few words. The big model checks them all at once. You get
  the same answer, 1.6-1.8x sooner.
- **Long texts are read in big pieces** (up to 8,192 tokens at a time), at over 1,000 tokens per second.
