# NInfer Jetson Orin Port Status

Status assessed: 2026-09-26.

Phases 0 through 2 are complete, and Phase 3 is qualified for the tested SM87
operator and real-model scope. The fixed-clock SM87 experiment campaign is
complete: performance matrices, traced schedule trials, capacity gates, and
terminal safety classifications are recorded in the experiment ledger. The
governing sequence and detailed inventory remain in
[the port plan](NINFER_JETSON_ORIN_PORT_PLAN.md).

The public README now documents only the Jetson AGX Orin Arm64/Ubuntu product
and its JetPack 6.2/CUDA 12.6 and JetPack 7.1/CUDA 13.1 build targets. It
explains the SM86-to-SM87 and physical-unified-memory differences from the
upstream RTX 3090 project and removes the superseded desktop platform guide.

## Phase status

| Phase | Current state | Remaining acceptance work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — Baseline and inventory | Source inventory complete; inherited SM86 behavior documented. | No fresh SM86 runtime baseline was established. Published validation is the baseline evidence currently available. |
| 1 — CUDA 12.6 compatibility | E2M1 decode backported and exactly qualified; complete CUDA 12.6/SM86 build passed; the floor change and newer-toolkit compatibility are documented. | No remaining Phase 1 acceptance work. |
| 2 — Native aarch64 build | Native dependency setup, full aarch64 compilation, application help checks and focused runtime tests passed. | No CPU portability fix has been needed. |
| 3 — SM87 correctness | Explicit architecture 87 configuration is enabled. The full native SM87 build passed 480/480 compile/link steps; the native device/runtime, CUDA Graph, E2M1 codec, 30 core scheduling/state tests, 21 supported operator/projection tests, real Qwen3.8-27B prefix integration, BF16 causal scoring, INT8-KV MTP generation and short CLI/MTP generation tests pass on Orin. A repeated 64-token CLI decode also reproduced identical output and MTP counters across two fresh processes. | The original FP8 causal-score fixture now skips cleanly on SM87 because that route has no supported implementation; BF16 scoring is the qualified Orin path. |
| 4 — Orin performance baseline | Fixed-clock `pp512+tg64` controls cover BF16 MTP-off/draft-2/draft-3/draft-4 at 7.68/10.60/10.98/9.39 decode tok/s and INT8 at 7.70/10.26/11.00/9.05. At `pp2048+tg128`, BF16 draft-4 is best at 17.86 decode tok/s; INT8 draft-3 reaches 17.26 at 93.07% acceptance. | Complete; the additional INT8 draft-2/draft-4 extension is pressure-limited before prefill. |
| 5 — SM87 schedule tuning | The traced Q4/Q5 attention-input grouped projection selects R64C128S2 at T>=21. At T=1024 its public-op median is 13.570 ms, 37.3% faster than the former R32C64S4 route; its numerical test passes. | Complete; rejected tile, cache, scale, and pipeline variants are retained in the ledger. |
| 6 — Memory experiments | Explicit `cudaMalloc` remains the control. An opt-in stream-ordered `cudaMallocAsync`/`cudaFreeAsync` class is qualified for `DeviceBuffer` and `DeviceArena` allocation, transfer, suballocation, and destruction on Orin. | Complete: retain explicit allocation because the pool class has no demonstrated end-to-end advantage or graph-stability qualification. |
| 7 — Capacity/context tuning | The selected long-context point is 32,768 prompt tokens plus one generated token for BF16 and INT8 KV; INT8 uses a 1.03 GiB KV payload and BF16 2.00 GiB. The 1.2 GiB guarded 40,960-token retry reached benchmark dispatch but stopped at 1.06 GiB. | Complete: pressure boundary only; the active guard is 1.2 GiB. |
| 8 — Final qualification | ✅ Complete. Fixed-clock, cache-disabled `pp512+tg64` INT8-KV/MTP-3 comparison: initial SM87 235.01 PP / 10.976 TG tok/s; tuned SM87 242.28 / 10.981. llama.cpp UD-Q4_K_M reference measures 252.06 PP / 8.434 TG. | Q4 is matched-family only: its GGUF weights and FP16 KV are not groupwise-int/INT8-KV equivalent. Power is the `VDD_GPU_SOC` rail, not whole-board input power. |
| 9 — 35B-A3B MoE performance matrix | ✅ Complete. Pinned v2 groupwise-int artifact: full short/long BF16+INT8 MTP matrices, plus 8K/16K/32K capacity gates, all pass. Short BF16/INT8 MTP-2 reaches 43.63 / 42.16 TG tok/s; long BF16/INT8 MTP-4 reaches 62.91 / 62.31 TG tok/s. | Current publisher v3 artifact is retained but incompatible with the port's v1/v2 reader; results use publisher v2 revision `3c739ac9`. DFlash is outside the comparable MTP matrix. |

## Evidence retained from the interrupted work

After external services were reduced, the selected-route 1.2 GiB guarded
retries still stopped during common model setup: long INT8 draft-2 at 1.167 GiB
after 10.02 seconds and the 40,960-token gate at 1.075 GiB after 9.76 seconds.
The latter reached dispatch but neither produced a benchmark result.

The plan's execution-status section records the initial investigation. Those
historical observations are retained below for provenance; later milestones
supersede the initial “no full build” state.

- Host/toolchain: Linux aarch64, GCC 11.4, CMake 4.0.2 and explicitly selected
  `/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin/nvcc` (CUDA 12.6.77).
- Initial configuration in `build/port-cuda126-sm86`, with architecture 86 and
  apps, tests and benchmarks enabled, passed compiler detection but stopped at
  the project's CUDA 12.8 minimum. This was the pre-backport result; the later
  CUDA 12.6 build completed successfully.
- A direct CUDA 12.6/SM86 compilation probe of
  `src/ops/linear/nvfp4/nvfp4_gemv.cu` failed on missing `cuda_fp4.h`.
  The supported A16 weight-decode route uses that header; disabling NVFP4
  weight loading would regress the existing behavior.
- Installed FFmpeg pkg-config versions were 58.76.100 / 58.134.100 /
  56.70.100 / 5.9.100, below the required 60 / 60 / 58 / 7 major versions.
  `libcurl.pc` was absent; the project requires libcurl >=7.85.
- The initial sandboxed `nvidia-smi` attempt failed with NvRm initialization/
  driver-access errors. An unrestricted check later succeeded and identified
  Orin; the sandbox error did not represent host GPU availability.
- The inherited README reports Windows v0.6.0 validation and the Linux
  v0.6.1 CUDA 13.1 compile/link gate (245 steps and application help).
  Linux real-artifact generation and performance remain unqualified there.

## Checkout verification at resumption (before implementation)

- Before this update, tracked files had no local changes; the port plan was
  untracked. HEAD was `75d94eab` (upstream-catchup merge), with no subsequent
  port implementation commit in the current branch.
- At the initial checkout, `CMakeLists.txt` defaulted to SM86, accepted only
  86/89 and required CUDA >=12.8. The existing `NINFER_SM8X_COMPAT` selection
  remains unchanged.
- `src/ops/linear/nvfp4/nvfp4_codec.cuh` still includes `cuda_fp4.h` and
  decodes through `__nv_fp4x2_e2m1`; the proposed backport is absent.
- The retained `build/port-cuda126-sm86/CMakeCache.txt` confirms the explicit
  CUDA 12.6 compiler, architecture 86 and enabled apps/tests/benchmarks.
  The directory contains the cache and CMake metadata, but no generated
  Ninja build file.

These checks corroborated the saved stopping point. Subsequent work is recorded below.

## Resume point

1. Completed: replace the CUDA FP4-header dependency with exact E2M1 decoding,
   check all 256 packed bytes and isolate unsupported A4 quantization from SM8x.
2. Resolve the native FFmpeg/libcurl build prerequisites without silently
   reducing the dependency contract. Establish the complete CUDA 12.6/SM86
   build using the configuration recorded in the plan and
   `cmake --build build/port-cuda126-sm86 -j`; qualify the toolkit-floor
   change with compatibility evidence.
3. Run available SM86 correctness/model checks, explicitly retaining any
   hardware-dependent validation gap. Finish the native-build gate before
   introducing SM87 execution changes.
4. For SM87, review cooperative-grid residency in particular: the inventory
   identifies an 82-SM minimum/fallback and fixed occupancy/shared-memory
   assumptions in the GDN planner. Complete numerical and real-model gates
   before performance tuning.

Keep explicit device allocation as the initial execution model. Memory-policy
experiments and schedule optimization remain later, separately verified phases.

## Resumed Phase 3 milestone — native SM87 compilation path

- CMake now accepts `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=87` alongside the existing 86 and
  89 targets. The existing `NINFER_SM8X_COMPAT` capability path is enabled for
  SM87 as well, preserving the explicit rejection of Blackwell-only FP8/FP4
  tensor-core routes while retaining A16 decode and supported Ampere kernels.
- CUDA 12.6 native SM87 configuration completed on Orin's aarch64 environment.
  The focused native build produced device, CUDA Graph and NVFP4 codec tests.
- `ctest -R '^ninfer_(nvfp4_codec|device|decode_graph)_test$'` passed 3/3 on
  Orin. The codec comparison covers all 256 packed E2M1 bytes bit-for-bit,
  including signed zero. This is native SM87 evidence; it does not qualify the
  complete model schedule.
- The full SM87 project build passed. GDN cooperative-residency qualification is
  currently limited to the tested operator shapes. Existing planner catalogs
  were measured for 82–84-SM desktop GPUs. The
  planner now treats those boundaries as candidates and falls back to unsplit
  MMA when Orin's 16-SM resource budget cannot hold a cooperative grid.
- After that change, `ninfer_gdn_gating_proj_test` passed on native SM87,
  covering 27B/35B route boundaries, norm/control paths, independent numerical
  oracles and workspace contracts. This qualifies the planner fallback and
  operator behavior for its tested shapes; it is not yet model execution.
- The pinned Qwen3.8-27B groupwise artifact checksum passed exactly. The first
  model attempt happened during build/download pressure and saw only
  6,837,530,624 free bytes; after pressure cleared, the same artifact loaded and
  `ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_prefix_real_test` passed in 31.79 seconds with native SM87.
  That test exercises model admission/materialization, frontend, full prefill,
  state/checkpoint/prefix behavior and the configured MTP startup features. It
  is not a throughput measurement.
- The runtime capability gate now accepts SM87. The artifact's required weight
  allocation is approximately 17.9 GB; the Orin reported 26.25 GB free after
  the test and returned to that level after teardown.
- A short CLI smoke test with the pinned artifact, BF16 KV, greedy sampling and
  MTP draft window 2 generated `2 + 2 = **4**`. It completed 3 MTP rounds,
  drafted 5 tokens, accepted 4, and reported 80% acceptance (2.33 accepted
  tokens/round). This is a functional smoke result, not a performance baseline.
- Initial phase-4 sample used the same 23-token prompt, 32 generated tokens,
  greedy/no-thinking sampling, BF16 KV, explicit 2048-token capacity and native
  SM87. MTP off measured 37.34 prefill tok/s and 7.71 decode tok/s; MTP draft-2
  measured 36.24 prefill tok/s and 12.86 decode tok/s with 82.61% acceptance
  (2.58 accepted tokens/round). Weight materialization was 8.9–9.1 seconds and
  used 15.92–16.67 GiB. These are one-device smoke measurements, not a published
  performance claim; power mode and clocks were not fixed.
- The same sample at draft-3 measured 36.01 prefill tok/s, 16.06 decode tok/s,
  12.46 overall tok/s and 88.00% acceptance (3.44 accepted tokens/round), with
  no fallback steps. Draft-4 measured 35.62 prefill tok/s, 13.67 decode tok/s,
  10.98 overall tok/s and 68.75% acceptance, with one fallback step. The
  observed draft-3 advantage is a workload sample, not enough evidence to change
  a product default.
- A repeated fresh-process CLI run used the pinned artifact, the same 24-token
  prompt, 64 generated tokens, greedy/no-thinking sampling, BF16 KV and MTP
  draft-3. Both runs produced identical text, 23 MTP rounds, 67 drafted tokens,
  40 accepted tokens, 59.70% acceptance, no fallbacks and 12.75 decode tok/s.
  This supports repeated decode stability for this route; it is not a controlled
  power or clock-normalized performance baseline.
- The native SM87 operator and schedule sweep passed 51/51 selected tests: 30
  core scheduling/state/attention/MTP tests and 21 supported quantized linear,
  projection and GDN replay tests. The sweep excludes routes explicitly gated
  out on SM87, including FP8 linear/attention and A4 NVFP4 quantization.
- A real-model CLI smoke with the pinned artifact, greedy/no-thinking sampling,
  MTP draft-2 and INT8 group64 KV generated `2 + 2 = **4**`; it completed three
  rounds with 83.33% acceptance (2.67 accepted tokens/round). This qualifies the
  currently supported INT8 KV route on SM87.
- The controlled Phase 4 sample ran under the reported `MAXN` power mode with
  the existing dynamic clock policy. It used the pinned artifact, a 24-token
  prompt, 64 generated tokens, BF16 KV and MTP draft-3. The run measured 36.82
  prefill tok/s, 12.71 decode tok/s and 11.41 overall tok/s, with 59.70%
  acceptance and no fallback steps. `tegrastats` observed 99% GR3D utilization;
  GPU clock locking was unavailable without elevated Jetson privileges, so this
  is a controlled-power-mode sample rather than a final clock-normalized result.
- A same-session MAXN comparison held the pinned artifact, prompt, 64-token
  output limit, greedy/no-thinking sampling and BF16 KV constant across all
  MTP modes. MTP off measured 7.69 decode tok/s, draft-2 11.57, draft-3 12.75
  and draft-4 10.86. Draft-3 was the fastest of these runs, while draft-4's
  acceptance fell to 44.94%; this is a baseline observation, not a product
  default change.
- The product benchmark repeated each `pp512+tg64` case three times after one
  warmup with a single loaded engine. Results were: MTP off 238.09 prefill and
  7.67 decode tok/s; draft-2 236.24 and 10.57 tok/s at 58.62% acceptance;
  draft-3 235.38 and 10.98 tok/s at 47.44% acceptance; draft-4 234.96 and
  9.37 tok/s at 35.92% acceptance. The benchmark's CUDA-Graph MTP paths had no
  fallback steps. This is the first repeat-based product benchmark evidence;
  clock locking remains the outstanding control for final publication.
- Fixed-clock controls are now available through noninteractive `sudo`. The
  pre-change policy was saved, `jetson_clocks` locked the GPU at 1,300.5 MHz,
  all twelve CPU cores at 2,201.6 MHz, and EMC override was enabled under
  MAXN. The first three-repetition `pp512+tg64` controls with the pinned
  artifact measured BF16 MTP-off at 238.35 prefill / 7.68 decode tok/s. The
  complete INT8 matrix measured MTP-off at 237.88 / 7.70; draft-2 at 235.91 /
  10.26 with 54.10% acceptance; draft-3 at 235.32 / 11.00 with 47.44%
  acceptance and three fallback steps; and draft-4 at 234.59 / 9.05 with
  33.64% acceptance. These controls retained tegrastats logs and showed
  98–99% GR3D utilization without a visible clock drop. The matching BF16
  MTP matrix measured draft-2 at 236.42 / 10.60 tok/s with 58.62% acceptance,
  draft-3 at 235.76 / 10.98 with 47.44%, and draft-4 at 235.13 / 9.39 with
  35.92%; each speculative case recorded three fallback steps. Draft-3 remains
  the fixed-clock winner for both KV formats.
- The larger fixed-clock BF16 `pp2048+tg128` control retained the same artifact,
  three measured repetitions, one warmup, 4096-token reservation and CUDA-Graph
  product route. MTP-off measured 239.51 prefill / 7.62 decode tok/s. Draft-3
  measured 238.49 / 17.21 tok/s at 93.07% acceptance with no fallback steps.
  This is an initial longer-workload comparison, not the complete long matrix.
- The fixed-clock BF16 long-window extension measured draft-2 at 238.56
  prefill / 13.95 decode tok/s with 94.32% acceptance and three fallback
  steps; draft-4 measured 238.25 / 17.86 with 91.74% acceptance and no
  fallback steps. Draft-4 is the best measured BF16 window at this longer
  workload. The analogous INT8 extension was interrupted before a result when
  a lingering benchmark reduced host `MemAvailable` to 472 MiB; its exact
  processes were terminated and future retries require the pressure wrapper.
- The corresponding fixed-clock INT8 `pp2048+tg128` controls measured MTP-off
  at 238.44 prefill / 7.63 decode tok/s and draft-3 at 237.41 / 17.26 tok/s,
  also at 93.07% acceptance with no fallback steps. At this workload, the
  guarded draft-2 extension stopped during model setup at a 1.67 GiB
  `MemAvailable` sample, below the then-active 2 GiB floor; it did not reach
  prefill and draft-4 was not started. Host memory recovered immediately after
  termination, so this is a pressure-limited result rather than a throughput
  or correctness classification. The existing control shows that INT8 payload
  reduction does not trade away decode throughput.
- A local llama.cpp CUDA comparison at checkout `8be759e6f` used the
  Qwen3.8-27B Q4_K_XL GGUF, full GPU offload, Flash Attention, FP16 KV, and
  three repetitions under the same fixed-clock profile. It measured 238.15
  ± 4.21 prefill tok/s and 7.78 ± 0.06 decode tok/s. Its GGUF quantization and
  KV representation are not NInfer's groupwise `.ninfer` artifact, so this is
  a matched-family system reference rather than an exact-weight comparison.
- The native Qwen3.6-27B operator suite was also measured with five samples per
  point after two warmups on SM87. Representative cold-cache points were the
  Q4 draft head (N=131072,K=5120,T=1) at 2.58 ms and the Q5 GDN output gate
  (N=6144,K=5120,T=1) at 198 us. These measurements identify candidate routes
  for schedule work; they do not justify a kernel change by themselves.
- An Nsight Systems CUDA trace of the short BF16/MTP route identified the
  quantized Q4/Q5 GEMM families as the dominant GPU kernel-time contributors,
  with GDN recurrent kernels and attention below them. This is Phase 5 triage
  evidence only; no SM87 schedule has been changed from the qualified
  implementation yet.
- A fixed-clock Nsight Systems trace of the longer INT8 `pp2048+tg128`,
  draft-3 route confirms that attribution: the Q4 SwiGLU split-half pair GEMM
  consumed 40.1% of GPU kernel time, the Q5 rowsplit MMA GEMM 26.7%, and the
  Q4 grouped rowsplit MMA path 15.3%. GDN state passing (1.1%) and INT8 causal
  attention (1.0%) are secondary. This identifies the Q4 SwiGLU pair path as
  the first explicit SM87 schedule candidate; no code change is justified
  until a competing schedule is measured end-to-end.
- Direct SM87 Q4 SwiGLU T=1024 operator experiments then compared 64- and
  96-column split-half pair tiles with the qualified 128-column tile. C64/C96
  were numerically qualified but measured 42.44/38.21 ms versus C128's 28.44–
  28.53 ms under the same cold-cache protocol, so both were removed. C128
  remains the selected large-prefill schedule; these results do not establish
  an end-to-end change.
- The traced Q5 GDN output-gate geometry (`N=6144,K=5120,T=1024`) similarly
  rejected its already-qualified C64 ping-pong schedule: it passed the Q5
  oracle but measured 7.271 ms through public Linear versus 5.019 ms for the
  selected C128 serial schedule. The C128 dispatch was restored.
- The C128 Q5 cache-policy alternative also lost on SM87: cache-all (`ca`)
  loads passed the Q5 oracle but measured 6.075 ms against 5.008 ms for the
  streaming (`cg`) control, so the qualified `cg` schedule was restored.
- Explicit-capacity startup probes at 8,192, 16,384 and 32,768 tokens passed for
  both BF16 and INT8 KV with the pinned artifact. At 32,768 tokens, BF16 used a
  2.00 GiB KV payload and reported 9.47 GiB free after startup; INT8 used a
  1.03 GiB payload and reported 10.39 GiB free. These are capacity-headroom
  probes with a short prompt, not maximum-context or long-prefill claims.
- Real long-context prefill gates then passed at 32,768 prompt tokens plus one
  generated token with the pinned artifact and eager execution. INT8 KV measured
  209.03 prefill tok/s with a 1.03 GiB KV payload; BF16 measured 211.50 prefill
  tok/s with a 2.00 GiB payload. Both runs completed with the configured 32,769
  token capacity and retained the engine's reported startup headroom.
- On 2026-09-22, a bounded eager `pp40960+tg1` INT8-KV benchmark began after
  model load but its execution channel disappeared before a result was returned.
  Immediately afterward the host reported 29 GiB RAM used, 174 MiB available,
  and 663 MiB swap used, although no GPU or host benchmark process remained.
  Memory recovered to 25.9 GiB free shortly afterward. This is an interrupted
  pressure observation, not a pass, failure classification, or practical-limit
  claim. Do not repeat it until the run can retain host-pressure telemetry.
- A later fixed-clock retry used `tools/bench/run_with_host_pressure.py`, which
  samples `/proc/meminfo` every 250 ms and terminates the child below its then-active 2 GiB
  `MemAvailable` floor. The run was stopped during setup after 10.76 seconds;
  its lowest retained `MemAvailable` sample was 1.49 GiB and swap remained
  essentially unchanged. It did not reach prefill, so it remains neither a
  pass nor a measured upper-context point, but it is a safe pressure-limited
  result and the earlier execution-channel loss was not reproduced.
- Shared operator benchmark reporting now derives its informational DRAM
  roofline from CUDA's memory-clock and bus-width attributes rather than the
  former RTX 5090-only constant. The target-specific linear benchmark retains
  its explicitly labeled RTX 5090 reference columns for cross-device schedule
  comparison; its SM87 measurements are not used as native roofline values.
- The complete native CTest sweep passed all 96 tests that were eligible under
  the configured artifact/environment; five unrelated target fixtures skipped
  because their source artifacts were not present. The one apparent failure in
  the first sweep was a variable mismatch: the Qwen3.8 artifact was supplied to
  the Qwen3.6-named prefix fixture. Rerunning that established prefix gate with
  `NINFER_QWEN3_8_27B_WEIGHTS` passed in 31.87 seconds.
- The causal-score real test was attempted with the pinned artifact and reached
  the runtime correctly, but its fixture requests FP8 E4M3 KV. The runtime
  rejects that storage on SM87 because the FP8 causal-attention implementation
  is limited to newer architectures; the fixture now reports a clean skip on
  Orin. A companion BF16 fixture runs the same 1,537-token overlap and repeated
  window checks; it passed on native SM87 in 29.70 seconds with finite scores,
  overlap error within the 0.25 tolerance and no state/KV contamination.

## Artifact acquisition milestone

- Downloaded the documented Qwen3.8-27B groupwise NInfer artifact to
  `/home/calvin/models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer`. The completed file is
  20,437,521,664 bytes. The pinned v1 artifact used for native qualification is
  `/home/calvin/models/qwen3_8_27b_v1/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer`; its SHA-256 matches
  `model-cards/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer/SHA256SUMS` exactly.
- The source was selected by the exact documented model identity,
  `neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer`, rather than by filename or
  modification time. The current `main` artifact is 20,437,521,664 bytes with
  SHA-256 `81f924d440c27261d820c19a9f8d45794c5aee410f8a68bd358133fa8c0375da`,
  while this checkout's pinned v1 manifest expects 18,210,531,328 bytes and
  SHA-256 `eec39564993d6e9c7d5e383382a760f093465c9d163ec9a1bd6b80199514bf3e`.
  The current main artifact is container v3 and is not accepted as the pinned
  runtime artifact. The matching historical revision
  `3526913004b1cf552cb57b88d6a5c6f5e4a89a70` is now downloading into
  `/home/calvin/models/qwen3_8_27b_v1`; it will be checksum-verified before use.
  The GGUF files under `~/models` remain reference material for llama.cpp only
  and are not passed to NInfer.

## Resumed Phase 1 milestone — exact E2M1 decode

- Replaced the CUDA FP4 type conversion with direct exact FP32 bit construction.
  A16 NVFP4 weight support is preserved; A4-only quantization helpers are excluded
  under the existing SM8x capability definition. No architecture or schedule changed.
- Added `ninfer_nvfp4_codec_test`, which executes the production device decoder
  for every packed byte and compares both FP32 outputs bit-for-bit with the
  existing independent test-owned E2M1 magnitude-table oracle. Signed zeros and
  nibble ordering are included.
- CUDA 12.6.77: standalone test compiled with C++20, `-arch=sm_86` and
  `NINFER_SM8X_COMPAT=1`; all 256 bytes passed on Orin. The previously failing
  `nvfp4_gemv.cu` also compiled successfully with the same profile.
- CUDA 12.9: the standalone decoder test compiled successfully. This is focused
  newer-toolkit compile evidence, not yet a full-project compatibility gate.
- Unrestricted `nvidia-smi` succeeds and identifies Orin, driver 540.4.0, CUDA
  12.6. Earlier GPU-access errors were caused by sandbox device isolation. GPU
  tests require execution outside that sandbox. Running SM86 code on Orin is
  evidence for this codec only, not SM86 hardware regression or SM87 qualification.
- Local FFmpeg 6.1.2 and curl 8.10.1 dependency builds completed under
  `build/jetson-deps`; system packages remain unchanged. The available Ubuntu
  packages (FFmpeg 4.4 and curl 7.81) do not meet the current project minimums.
- The committed toolkit floor remains 12.8. A candidate reduction to 12.6 is
  being exercised in the working tree and will be committed only with successful

## Native build prerequisites milestone

- Added [native Jetson development instructions](docs/jetson-orin.md), including
  explicit CUDA selection and an isolated dependency prefix. The desktop Docker
  image and system JetPack libraries are unchanged.
- CMake successfully configured the complete project with apps, tests and
  benchmarks enabled: Linux aarch64, GCC 11.4, CUDA 12.6.77, architecture 86,
  Python 3.11.12, FFmpeg 6.1.2 and curl 8.10.1.
- `cmake --build build/port-cuda126-sm86 -j` completed all 614 compile/link
  steps. CLI, server and perplexity `--help` checks passed. Device, CUDA Graph,
  arena, public API, wide-math, artifact-reader, and media-decode tests passed;
  media-decode required `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the local dependency prefix.
- The real-shape `ninfer_linear_nvfp4_a16_test` was stopped after 11 minutes of
  PTX-JIT activity with zero GPU utilization. An SM86 binary is not a valid
  native Orin qualification: with `CUDA_DISABLE_PTX_JIT=1` it fails with “PTX
  JIT compilation was disabled”. Native SM87 compilation is required for the
  next GPU qualification step.
- The user clarified that `~/.ninfer` is a placeholder configuration file, not
  model storage. The actual model root is `~/models` (`/home/calvin/models`).
  That directory contains downloaded GGUF files, including:
  `qwen3.8-27b/Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf` (17,559,178,144 bytes),
  `qwen3.8-27b-iq3s/Qwen3.8-27B-UD-IQ3_S.gguf` (12,040,883,104 bytes),
  `qwen3.8-27b/MTP/mtp-Qwen3.8-27B-Q4_0.gguf` (1,369,590,656 bytes), and
  `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTP-GGUF/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-IQ4_NL.gguf`
  (18,536,192,288 bytes). No `.ninfer` artifact is present under `~/models`.
  These GGUF files are not interchangeable with NInfer's registered `.ninfer`
  artifacts. A compatible Qwen3.8-27B groupwise artifact is now being downloaded
  to `/home/calvin/models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer` from the documented
  `neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer` repository. Real-model gates remain pending the
  completed checksum and native SM87 build.
