# NInfer on Jetson AGX Orin

This repository is the Jetson port of NInfer: a native Arm64/aarch64 C++20/CUDA inference
engine for Qwen3-family `.ninfer` artifacts on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. The port exists because
the upstream [`ninfer-3090`](https://github.com/Don-Chad/ninfer-3090) project targets a discrete
RTX 3090 and its SM86 execution and memory assumptions do not describe Orin.

The supported platform is Ubuntu on Jetson AGX Orin:

| Platform | CUDA | GPU target | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| JetPack 6.2 | 12.6 | SM87 (`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=87`) | Native qualification platform |
| JetPack 7.1 | 13.1 | SM87 (`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=87`) | Supported build target; repeat native qualification on the installed image |

The code is deliberately native aarch64, and this README documents only the Jetson Ubuntu path.

## Recommended Orin settings

For the best practical default on this qualification host, use the registered Qwen3.8-27B
groupwise-int artifact with INT8 group-64 KV and the optimized three-token MTP draft. This is the
best measured short-workload decode setting and halves the KV payload relative to BF16:

```bash
sudo nvpmodel -m 0
sudo jetson_clocks

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build/jetson-deps/install/lib/ \
  build/port-cuda126-sm87/apps/ninfer \
  /home/calvin/models/qwen3_8_27b_v1/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --prompt 'Explain paged KV caching in two sentences.' \
  --max-context 32768 --kv-capacity 32768 --max-new 128 \
  --kv-dtype int8 --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft \
  --no-thinking --greedy
```

To serve the same configuration through OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible HTTP endpoints, build the
server target once and start it with the dependency prefix:

```bash
cmake --build build/port-cuda126-sm87 -j --target ninfer-serve

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build/jetson-deps/install/lib/ \
  build/port-cuda126-sm87/apps/ninfer-serve \
  /home/calvin/models/qwen3_8_27b_v1/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 \
  --max-context 32768 --kv-capacity 32768 --max-concurrency 1 \
  --kv-dtype int8 --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft
```

See [HTTP serving](docs/serving.md) for API-key, streaming, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages,
vision, and request-log options.

For the highest measured long-output throughput (`pp2048+tg128`), change the KV format to BF16
and use a four-token MTP draft:

```bash
  --kv-dtype bf16 --spec mtp --draft-tokens 4 --lm-head-draft
```

These are fixed-clock, single-request recommendations. The 32,768-token context setting is the
qualified capacity point; use a smaller explicit context when it better matches the request. See
the [experiment ledger](NINFER_JETSON_ORIN_PORT_EXPERIMENTS.md) for throughput, power, and
matched-family llama.cpp comparison details.

## Why this port is different

The upstream RTX 3090 implementation is compiled and tuned for **SM86** (GA102), a discrete GPU
with dedicated device memory. Orin is **SM87** (GA10B), with 16 SMs and physically unified LPDDR
shared by the CPU and GPU. SM86 and SM87 are related Ampere architectures, but they are different
execution targets: launch residency, shared-memory/register budgets, device properties, and
supported tensor-core routes must be qualified on the actual GPU.

Physical memory being shared does not make every CUDA allocation a Unified Memory allocation.
This port keeps explicit `cudaMalloc` as its selected device-allocation model. An opt-in
stream-ordered `cudaMallocAsync`/`cudaFreeAsync` class is qualified for core buffer and arena
ownership on Orin, but it is not the Engine default because no end-to-end gain or CUDA-Graph
stability advantage has been demonstrated. `cudaMallocManaged`, mapped host memory, and other
strategies are not enabled globally merely because Orin has unified physical memory. CUDA Graph
address stability, page residency, synchronization, and CPU access behavior still depend on the
allocation type.

The port therefore makes the following boundaries explicit:

- CUDA 12.6 is the minimum tested toolkit, while CUDA 13.1 remains a supported newer toolkit.
- SM87 is an explicit architecture target; it is not silently treated as SM86.
- BF16 and INT8 KV-cache routes are qualified on Orin. FP8 E4M3 causal attention is unavailable
  on SM87 and reports a clean unsupported-route skip.
- NVFP4 weight decoding remains available through the A16 dequantizing route. A4 NVFP4 and other
  Blackwell-only tensor-core routes are not emulated on Orin.
- Cooperative schedules use actual Orin residency information and fall back to a legal unsplit
  route when a desktop-sized cooperative grid cannot fit its 16-SM budget.

## Current qualification state

Phases 0–2 of the [port plan](NINFER_JETSON_ORIN_PORT_PLAN.md) are complete. Phase 3 SM87
correctness is qualified for the tested operator and real-model scope, including native build,
CUDA Graphs, NVFP4 codec, Q4/Q5/W8/BF16 routes, GDN paths, real-model prefix/state behavior,
BF16 causal scoring, INT8-KV MTP generation, and repeated decode stability.

Phase 4 SM87 experiments have completed. Fixed `MAXN`/`jetson_clocks` measurements on the pinned
Qwen3.8-27B groupwise artifact establish MTP as the decisive decode optimization: draft-3 is best
at the short workload for both qualified KV formats, while BF16 draft-4 is best at the long
workload. INT8 KV halves the reserved KV payload at the qualified 32K capacity point without a
measured short-workload decode penalty.

The supported long-context point is **32,768 prompt tokens plus one generated token** for both
BF16 and INT8 KV. Those eager-prefill gates measure 211.50 BF16 and 209.03 INT8 prefill tok/s;
the respective KV payloads are 2.00 GiB and 1.03 GiB. The guarded 40,960-token INT8 attempt
stopped after dispatch below the retained 1.2 GiB host-memory floor, so it is a safety boundary—not a
capacity failure or a published maximum context.

| Best configuration | Workload | PP tok/s | TG tok/s | MTP acceptance |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| INT8 KV, draft-3 | `pp512+tg64` | 235.32 | **11.00** | 47.44% |
| BF16 KV, draft-3 | `pp512+tg64` | 235.76 | 10.98 | 47.44% |
| BF16 KV, draft-4 | `pp2048+tg128` | 238.25 | **17.86** | 91.74% |
| INT8 KV, draft-3 | `pp2048+tg128` | 237.41 | 17.26 | 93.07% |

### Dense and MoE before/after comparison

The table compares the MTP-off product-route baseline with the best measured
MTP configuration for the same model and workload. All rows use fixed
MAXN/`jetson_clocks`, CUDA 12.6, SM87, CUDA Graph decode, and three measured
repetitions after one warm-up. PP is prefill throughput; TG is generated-token
throughput. The MoE rows use the compatible pinned v2
`qwen3.6-35b-a3b/groupwise-int` artifact, rather than the newer publisher v3
container, which this port's v1/v2 reader cannot load.

| Model / workload | Before optimization | PP / TG before | After optimization | PP / TG after | PP change | TG change |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.8-27B dense, `pp512+tg64` | BF16 KV, MTP off | 238.35 / 7.68 | INT8 KV, MTP-3 | 235.32 / **11.00** | -1.3% | **+43.2%** |
| Qwen3.8-27B dense, `pp2048+tg128` | BF16 KV, MTP off | 239.51 / 7.62 | BF16 KV, MTP-4 | 238.25 / **17.86** | -0.5% | **+134.4%** |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B MoE, `pp512+tg64` | BF16 KV, MTP off | 1192.99 / 37.50 | BF16 KV, MTP-2 | 1178.62 / **43.63** | -1.2% | **+16.3%** |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B MoE, `pp2048+tg128` | BF16 KV, MTP off | 1376.16 / 36.68 | BF16 KV, MTP-4 | 1359.73 / **62.91** | -1.2% | **+71.5%** |

For the dense model, the separate SM87 attention-input schedule optimization
also improves the fixed short INT8/MTP-3 prefill result from 235.01 to 242.28
tok/s (+3.1%) while leaving decode effectively unchanged (10.976 to 10.981
tok/s). The MTP window, not that kernel schedule change, is the dominant
decode optimization in both model families.

SM87 kernel work also replaced the Q4/Q5 attention-input large-prefill route with R64C128S2.
At T=1024, its public-op median is 13.570 ms, 37.3% faster than the original R32C64S4 route;
the associated numerical test passes.

The accepted llama.cpp comparator uses the downloaded UD-Q4_K_M GGUF, full CUDA offload,
FlashAttention, and FP16 KV. It is a matched-family conventional-Q4 system reference, not an exact
groupwise-int or KV-format equivalent to NInfer.

The full result matrix—including rejected schedules, capacity guard outcomes, commands, and
hardware context—is in the [SM87 experiment ledger](NINFER_JETSON_ORIN_PORT_EXPERIMENTS.md).
See the [live port status](NINFER_JETSON_ORIN_PORT_STATUS.md) for current port provenance and
limitations.

### Phase 8 comparison

At fixed MAXN/`jetson_clocks`, with `pp512+tg64`, 2,048-token reservation, and the standalone
`--no-prefix-reuse` benchmark mode, the reconstructed initial SM87 route measures 235.01 PP and
10.976 TG tok/s. The selected R64C128S2 route measures 242.28 PP and 10.981 TG tok/s: a 3.1%
prefill improvement and effectively unchanged decode. TTFT is 2.179 s initial versus 2.113 s
tuned. The corresponding `VDD_GPU_SOC` measured-window means are 40.18 W and 41.38 W, yielding
5.849/5.855 PP tokens/J and 0.273/0.265 TG tokens/J. The accepted llama.cpp UD-Q4_K_M reference
is 252.06 PP and 8.434 TG tok/s; its conventional GGUF Q4 weights and FP16 KV are not an exact
NInfer weight/KV comparison.

## Build on Orin

Install the JetPack-provided CUDA, compiler, CMake, Ninja, pkg-config, and Python 3.11 packages.
The project also requires FFmpeg >=6 and libcurl >=7.85. On the qualification host, those were
built into the isolated `build/jetson-deps/install` prefix; do not replace JetPack system
libraries globally.

Select the toolkit explicitly and configure an SM87 build:

```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.6
export PATH="$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PWD/build/jetson-deps/install/lib/pkgconfig${PKG_CONFIG_PATH:+:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/build/jetson-deps/install/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"

cmake -S . -B build/port-cuda126-sm87 -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER="$CUDA_HOME/bin/nvcc" \
  -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=87 \
  -DNINFER_BUILD_APPS=ON \
  -DNINFER_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON \
  -DBUILD_TESTING=ON \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$PWD/build/jetson-deps/install"

cmake --build build/port-cuda126-sm87 -j
ctest --test-dir build/port-cuda126-sm87 --output-on-failure
```

For JetPack 7.1, select `/usr/local/cuda-13.1/bin/nvcc` and use a separate build directory, for
example `build/port-cuda131-sm87`. Keep the architecture at 87; CUDA version selection and SM87
qualification are separate checks.

## Tested artifact and CLI

The native real-model gates use the checksum-matched historical v1 artifact:

```text
/home/calvin/models/qwen3_8_27b_v1/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer
SHA-256: eec39564993d6e9c7d5e383382a760f093465c9d163ec9a1bd6b80199514bf3e
```

The GGUF files under `/home/calvin/models` are reference material for other runtimes and are not
interchangeable with NInfer's registered `.ninfer` product artifact. The `~/.ninfer` path on the
qualification host is a placeholder configuration file, not a model directory.

Run a short BF16-KV MTP generation:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build/jetson-deps/install/lib/ \
  build/port-cuda126-sm87/apps/ninfer \
  /home/calvin/models/qwen3_8_27b_v1/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --prompt 'What is 2+2?' --max-new 16 --no-thinking --greedy \
  --kv-dtype bf16 --spec mtp --draft-tokens 2 --lm-head-draft
```

Use `--kv-dtype int8` for the qualified INT8 group-64 KV route. Keep explicit context capacity
while measuring; `--max-context` and `--kv-capacity` control the reservation independently.

## Product surface

NInfer exposes one public Engine route for the registered `.ninfer` artifacts. The native CLI and
serving applications share the same model admission, frontend, state transactions, paged KV,
CUDA Graph, MTP, prefix-reuse, and output semantics. OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses,
and Anthropic Messages serving are available through the native Arm64 build.

The current product is one resident model instance on one Orin GPU with bounded one-to-eight
request concurrency. Large-scale preemptive continuous batching and unqualified additional
checkpoint identities remain outside this port's validated scope.

For the repeatable benchmark command and Jetson dependency workflow, see
[Native Jetson development](docs/jetson-orin.md). For CLI options and serving behavior, see the
[documentation map](docs/README.md).
